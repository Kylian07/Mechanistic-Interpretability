Layer 5, Feature 3482
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Interpretation:
After analyzing the given data from the sparse autoencoder feature on MRPC paraphrase detection, I notice that this feature responds to a pattern or concept related to "similarity in word choice or phrase structure between two sentences, particularly in the context of synonyms or near-synonyms."

More specifically, the high activations in the feature are often found in regions where the two sentences have similar word choices or phrases, such as:

* Similar verbs (e.g., "said" and "refused to say"), synonyms (e.g., "sluggish" and "slow"), or near-synonyms (e.g., "killed" and "injured").
* Similar prepositional phrases (e.g., "in response to" and "

Layer 5, Feature 4817
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Interpretation:
This sparse autoencoder feature responds to the pattern or concept of **redundancy or word repetition** in the paraphrased text. 

The feature is highly active when there is a repeated word or phrase in the two sentences, such as "sluggish sales" and "Cisco pared spending to compensate for sluggish sales", or "refused to recuse himself from the case" and "Service officials said Carlson refused to recuse himself from the case". This suggests that the feature is detecting the similarity between the two sentences and is highly active when there is a direct repetition of words or phrases. 

This pattern is consistent across all the examples provided, where the feature is highly active when there is a repeated word or phrase in the two sentences

Layer 5, Feature 17468
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Interpretation:
After analyzing the given activation patterns for the sparse autoencoder feature from GPT-2 on MRPC paraphrase detection, I've identified a specific pattern or concept that this feature responds to.

This feature appears to respond to **similar phrases or sentences with slight rewording**, particularly when the rewording involves **rearranging or omitting words**. This is evident in examples 2 and 5, where the sentences are almost identical, and the feature activations are relatively high, indicating a strong response to the similarity.

In example 1, the feature responds to the similarity between two sentences with slightly different wording, but the response is weaker compared to examples 2 and 5.

In example 4, the feature does not respond strongly

Layer 5, Feature 38895
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Interpretation:
This sparse autoencoder feature from GPT-2 on MRPC paraphrase detection appears to respond to the pattern or concept of **semantic equivalence in negated or contrasting phrases**.

The feature is activated when the two sentences in a pair have similar meaning but with negated or contrasting elements, such as "not recuse himself" vs. "refused to recuse himself" or "sluggish sales" vs. "in response to sluggish sales". The feature's strong activations are often found at the positions of words related to negation or contrast, such as "not", "refused", "in response to", etc.

This suggests that the feature is learning to capture the semantic relationships between sentences with negated or contrasting elements, which

Layer 5, Feature 45079
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Interpretation:
This sparse autoencoder feature from GPT-2 appears to respond to the pattern of "sentence paraphrasing with minor semantic changes." 

This is evident in examples 1 and 2, where the sentences are paraphrased versions of each other but with slight changes in wording. The feature's high activation in these examples suggests that it is sensitive to these minor semantic changes.

Similarly, in examples 4 and 5, the sentences are also paraphrased versions of each other, and the feature shows high activation.

In contrast, in example 3, the sentences are not paraphrased versions of each other, and the feature shows relatively low activation.

Overall, this feature appears to be detecting subtle patterns in language that indicate paraphrasing, and
