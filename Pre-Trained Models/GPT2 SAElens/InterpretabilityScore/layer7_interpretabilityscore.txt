This conclusion is drawn from the activation patterns across all five input sentences. In sentences 1 and 5, which express positive sentiments, the feature shows significant activation across multiple tokens. In contrast, sentences 2, 3, and 4, which have more neutral or negative tones, exhibit lower activation strengths. The feature seems to be more responsive to adjectives like "good," "original," "enjoyable," and "regal," which are often associated with positive emotions.
