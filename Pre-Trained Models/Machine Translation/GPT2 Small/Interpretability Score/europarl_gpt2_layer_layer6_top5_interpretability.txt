2. "(Parliament adopted the resolution) <|endoftext|> Je voudrais évoquer deux points tout à fait concrets."
Pattern: This feature detects **syntactic divergence** as the first sentence is a declaration, while the second is a wish to discuss something.

Interpretation: Based on the sparse autoencoder feature from GPT-2 on English-French translation pairs, here are the concise descriptions for each example:

1. **Translation pattern:** Syntactic, **Signals:** EQUIVALENCE
The feature detects a syntactic translation pattern and indicates a good translation, preserving the sentence structure.

2. **Translation pattern:** Lexical, **Signals:** EQUIVALENCE
The feature detects a lexical translation pattern and indicates a good translation, matching the vocabulary and sentence structure.

3. **Translation pattern:** Lexical, **Signals:** EQUIVALENCE
The feature detects a lexical translation pattern and indicates a good translation, matching the vocabulary and sentence structure.

4. **Translation pattern:** Semantic, **Signals:**

Layer 6, Feature 7683
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Interpretation: **1. Translation pattern detected:** This feature detects **lexical** translation patterns, specifically related to proper noun translation.

**Signal:** **DIVERGENCE** (bad translation), as the feature highlights differences in proper noun translation ("Davies" vs. "Murphy").



**2. Translation pattern detected:** This feature detects **lexical** translation patterns, specifically related to sentence structure and word order.

**Signal:** **EQUIVALENCE** (good translation), as the feature highlights the translation of a formal sentence structure.



**3. Translation pattern detected:** This feature detects **lexical** translation patterns, specifically related to sentence structure and word order.

**Signal:** **EQUIVALENCE** (good translation), as the feature

Layer 6, Feature 8399
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Interpretation: Based on the sparse autoencoder features from GPT-2 on English-French translation pairs, here are the concise sentences describing the translation patterns detected and whether they signal EQUIVALENCE or DIVERGENCE:

1. **Lexical/syntactic pattern, EQUIVALENCE**: This feature detects a direct translation pattern, focusing on the repetition of key terms and phrases.

2. **Semantic pattern, DIVERGENCE**: This feature detects a shift in the semantic meaning of the translation, possibly due to a loss of nuance or context.

3. **Lexical/semantic pattern, DIVERGENCE**: This feature detects a mismatch between the original English sentence and its French translation, possibly due to a loss of precision or

Layer 6, Feature 8851
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Interpretation: 1. Translation pattern detected: Lexical; 
Signal: DIVERGENCE (bad translation).

Explanation: This feature detects a mismatch between names (Davies and Murphy) which is a clear lexical error.

2. Translation pattern detected: Syntactic; 
Signal: DIVERGENCE (bad translation).

Explanation: This feature detects a syntactic mismatch, as the source sentence implies the adoption of a resolution, but the target sentence introduces unrelated points, indicating a poor translation.

3. Translation pattern detected: Semantic; 
Signal: DIVERGENCE (bad translation).

Explanation: This feature detects a significant semantic mismatch, as the source sentence expresses concern about xenophobia, but the target sentence suggests supporting it, which is a clear contradiction
