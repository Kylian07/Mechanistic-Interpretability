Feature: Feature 3086 (negative sentiment)

Llama 3 Interpretation:
After analyzing the given sentences and their corresponding activation strengths, I observe a strong correlation between the feature's activation and the presence of certain semantic patterns, particularly those related to the concepts of 'forced experience' or 'enduring unpleasantness'. 

This feature appears to be strongly activated when the text describes situations where someone is involuntarily subjected to a distressing, uncomfortable, or unpleasant experience, often involving other people. This could be due to various reasons such as watching an uninteresting video, being part of a dysfunctional family, or being forced to endure a lengthy and depressing scenario. 

The strong activation in sentences 1 and 5, where the speaker is forced to watch someone else's video or endure a family's dysfunctional behavior, supports this interpretation
